# Hospital-Ward-Management
A program that allows the management of a hospital ward. Includes patients, doctors, beds and their associated interactions. in a GUI made in Java Swing. An assignment for CMPT 270.

This is the 5th and final iteration of the program. Some code was provided by the professor but only code that had already been written by myself in previous versions. All classes in the gui folder are purely my own.

To run the program simply go to out -> artifacts -> Assignment5 -> Assignment5.jar and run the jar file or simply running the GuiHospitalSystem class also works.
